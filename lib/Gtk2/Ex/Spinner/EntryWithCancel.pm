=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::Spinner::EntryWithCancel -- Gtk2::Entry with a cancelled property

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::Spinner::EntryWithCancel;
 my $entry = Gtk2::Ex::Spinner::EntryWithCancel->new;

 $entry->signal_connect ('editing-done',
                         sub {
                           if ($entry->get('editing-cancelled'))
                             ...
                         });

=head1 WIDGET HIERARCHY

C<Gtk2::Ex::Spinner::EntryWithCancel> is a subclass of C<Gtk2::Entry>.

    Gtk2::Widget
      Gtk2::Entry
        Gtk2::Ex::Spinner::EntryWithCancel

And implements the interface

    Gtk2::CellEditable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Gtk2::Ex::Spinner::EntryWithCancel> is based on a great 
L<Gtk2::Ex::DateSpinner::EntryWithCancel>, so in most cases documentation 
is the same. License is (of course) the same too :-).

B<Caution: This is internals of C<Gtk2::Ex::Spinner::CellRenderer>.  If
it ends up with a use beyond that then it'll be split out and renamed.>

C<EntryWithCancel> extends C<Gtk2::Entry> to have an "editing-cancelled"
flag set when editing through the C<Gtk2::CellEditable> interface.  An an
Escape key press or C<cancel> action sets the flag.

C<Gtk2::Entry> already has such a flag (mis-spelt C<editing_canceled>) but
doesn't make it publicly available.  Is that right?  At any rate this
subclass gets the desired effect.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< $entry = Gtk2::Ex::Spinner::EntryWithCancel->new (key=>value,...) >>

Create and return a new EntryWithCancel object.  Optional key/value pairs
set initial properties as per C<< Glib::Object->new >>.  Eg.

    my $entry = Gtk2::Ex::Spinner::EntryWithCancel->new
                  (xalign => 0.5);

=item C<< $entry->cancel () >>

Emit the C<cancel> action signal, thus performing that action (see
L</SIGNALS> below).

=back

=head1 PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item C<editing-cancelled> (boolean, default false)

Cleared by C<start_editing> (the C<Gtk2::CellEditable> func) and then set to
true or false under an Escape (keypress), C<cancel> (below), or C<activate>
(C<Gtk2::Widget> signal).  C<editing-done> handlers (the
C<Gtk2::CellEditable> signal) can then consult the value.

=back

=head1 SIGNALS

=over 4

=item C<cancel> (action, no parameters)

Perform the cancel action, which is to set the C<editing-cancelled>
property, and if editing is active (from a C<start_editing>) then emit
C<editing-done> and C<remove-widget>.

The C<Escape> key binding runs this signal.
