NAME
    Gtk2::Ex::Spinner -- integer entry using SpinButtons

SYNOPSIS
     use Gtk2::Ex::Spinner;
     my $is = Gtk2::Ex::Spinner->new (value => 5);

WIDGET HIERARCHY
    "Gtk2::Ex::Spinner" is (currently) a subclass of "Gtk2::HBox", though
    it's probably not a good idea to rely on that.

        Gtk2::Widget
          Gtk2::Container
            Gtk2::Box
              Gtk2::HBox
                Gtk2::Ex::Spinner

DESCRIPTION
    "Gtk2::Ex::Spinner" is based on a great Gtk2::Ex::DateSpinner, so in
    most cases documentation is the same. License is (of course) the same
    too :-).

    "Gtk2::Ex::Spinner" displays and changes a integer using one
    "Gtk2::SpinButton" fields. The value is shown as below:

            +------+   
            |   99 |^  
            +------+v

    There's lots ways to enter/display an integer. This style is good for
    clicking to a nearby value, but also allows a value to be typed in if a
    long way away.

FUNCTIONS
    "$ds = Gtk2::Ex::Spinner->new (key=>value,...)"
        Create and return a new Spinner widget. Optional key/value pairs set
        initial properties per "Glib::Object->new". Eg.

            my $s = Gtk2::Ex::Spinner->new (value => 99);
